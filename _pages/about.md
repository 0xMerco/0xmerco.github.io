Hi! I go by T0b35 and work by day as a sysadmin for big company. I want to get a handle on the technical side of cyber security and am starting Hack The Box ([HTB](https://www.hackthebox.com/)) to learn some skills and have fun. My current goal is to get "Hacker" rank, but I plan to take my time in order to fully grasp concepts.

The point of this blogsite is to record my progress as well as push TTPs, Writeups and anything else I find interesting.
